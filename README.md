# Situational Velodrome Training
Outlines an implemtation of simi-randomized stragity based group situational velodrome training.

## Race and Situation Types
Race and situation types are further divided into stragity items.

### Points Race
Points race will be simulated using a shorter duration maximun of 10 laps, with sprints every 3.
- Early Break
- Take first in a sprint
- Take first the last sprint
- Take second or third on multiple sprints
- Lap the field
- Cover breakaways

### Elimination
Riders are elimated ever two laps until only 3 riders are remaining
- Sneek past people high on the track
- Hammer on the front
- Fight for 3rd weel
- Break from the group

### Kerin
Kerin is simulated using a three lap windup into a 500m sprint.  Rider take turns being the drubey.  Stragities are dictated via wheel position.
- 1st wheel provide a smooth windup
- 2nd wheel go as soon as allowed
- 3rd hold second wheel and over take at last moment possiable


### Scratch
First on the last lap wins
- Early break
- Cover breaks
- Stay shelterd for final lap

### SnowBall Sprint
Each lap is worth one more additional point than the last lap
- Take frist three laps
- Take middle lap
- Take last lap

### Win and In
Sprints every 3 laps with the winners qualifying for a 5 lap scratch


## Situation Setup
Once a situation is selected riders will be (simi-randomaly) assigned a stragity that is valid for that situation type.  Not every rider will receive a stragity.  
Those riders that are not assigned a stragity will support the current simulated situation.  Those duties include calling out lap numbers, keeping the pack together and keeping everyone safe.
If the stragities are assigned in secrecly see if you can guess who is implemting what.

## Expanded Stragities
The stragities above are simply listed because some situations implement the same stragity.  This section describes those in detail

### Support
Riding support for a simulation in not an walk in the park.  Call out lap numbers and sprints.  Keep the pack together by setting pace if approiate or helping rider that fall off.
Also provide freindly competition for others trying to implement stragities.

### Early Break
This break away should be at the very begging of the race.  If done correctly no one will take your seriously until you will the whole thing.

### Take first in a points sprint
Taking the first in only an single sprint can pay off when the group is well balanced and points are almost equaly awarded.

### Take first in the last sprint
The last sprint is usally worth more points that other sprints.  Save energy and hit that sprint hard.

### Take second or third in multiple sprints
Scrapping up as many smaller points can net you the win by meetering your sprint.

### Lap the field
Lapping the field can catipult you to victory but don't be suprized if other riders try to ride on your coat tails.  Convince them to pull thier share especially if your effort looks to be successfull.
If your effort is not successfull you may have reduce the field size which my help if you can make another attempt at the field later.

### Cover Breakaways
This is more of a race support stragity, howerver sometimes riders will bridge to rivels to prevent them from stealing the win.

### Sneak past people high on the track (devil take the high road)
While the track is longer the higher you are, you can also box adversaries in and prevent contested elimations

### Hammer on the front
Some times is pays to set the pase high enoght so that the race can continue behind you.

### Fight for 3rd wheel
Conserving energy is the game, but you must be high enought in the field to not be elimiated

### Break from the group
See Early Break

### 1st wheel in Kerin Simulation
Provide a smooth windup.  Stay a little lower from the rail than you normaily would.  That proides a buffer zone for riders behind you.
When starting the flying 500m carve to the sprinters lane and stay there for the rest of effort, other riders will pass above your, if they can.

### 2nd wheel in Kerin Simulation
Usually because of the windup firt wheel will be easly passed.  You should over take them quickly and stary your solo (no will pass you) 500m sprint,

### 3rd wheel in Kerin Simulation
Hold second wheel as long as need and then pass.  You will save energy in the draf but watch out for other riders who may over take both of you.

### Cover Breaks
Covering breaks before they become threating can keep you in a positon to sprint.  If you find youself in a break by accident do as little work as possiable

### Staying sheltered
Riding mid pack or higher can save tremendous amounts of energey and will allow for the strongest sprint possiable.  Work you way up as the sprint approches.

### Take the first three laps in the SnowBall sprint
Taking the first three laps in snowball sprint can give you a good lead in points.  If the next few laps are hevely contested you may win.  If you have a break continue to take laps as you can.

### Takeing middle laps
Taking middle laps may give you a chance at uncontested points.

### Taking the last lap
The last lap in most races are worth the most points.  Stay sheltered and hit the key sprint hard.
